Dynamic Programming (DP):

Use to solve optimization problems with overlapping subproblems.
Breaks down a problem into smaller subproblems and solves each subproblem only once.
Good for problems like the knapsack problem, longest common subsequence, etc.
Time Complexity: Depends on the problem.
Greedy Algorithms:

Use for optimization problems where a locally optimal solution leads to a globally optimal solution.
Simple and fast.
Examples include Huffman coding, Dijkstra's algorithm, etc.
Time Complexity: Depends on the problem.

Graph Algorithms:

Various algorithms exist for traversing, searching, and finding properties of graphs.
Examples include topological sorting, minimum spanning tree (Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm), shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, Floyd-Warshall), etc.
Time Complexity: Depends on the specific algorithm and problem.
Remember, the choice of algorithm depends on the problem statement and its constraints. As you practice more problems on platforms like LeetCode, you'll gain intuition on which algorithm to use for different types of problems.
