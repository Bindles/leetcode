#### Integers in Go
In Go, integers represent whole numbers without fractional parts. Go provides several built-in integer types with varying sizes:

Signed Integers:
int8: 8-bit signed integer (-128 to 127)
int16: 16-bit signed integer (-32,768 to 32,767)
int32 (or rune): 32-bit signed integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
int64: 64-bit signed integer (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)
int: Platform-specific signed integer (either 32 or 64 bits)
Unsigned Integers:
uint8 (or byte): 8-bit unsigned integer (0 to 255)
uint16: 16-bit unsigned integer (0 to 65,535)
uint32: 32-bit unsigned integer (0 to 4,294,967,295)
uint64: 64-bit unsigned integer (0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615)
uint: Platform-specific unsigned integer (either 32 or 64 bits)
Common Operations on Integers
Go provides various built-in functions and methods for working with integers. Here are some common operations:

Arithmetic Operations:

Addition: +
Subtraction: -
Multiplication: *
Division: /
Remainder (Modulus): %
Increment: ++
Decrement: --
Comparison Operations:

Equal to: ==
Not equal to: !=
Greater than: >
Less than: <
Greater than or equal to: >=
Less than or equal to: <=
Bitwise Operations:

Bitwise AND: &
Bitwise OR: |
Bitwise XOR: ^
Bitwise NOT: ~
Left Shift: <<
Right Shift: >>
Conversion Functions:

int(): Convert to int
float64(): Convert to float64
string(): Convert to string
